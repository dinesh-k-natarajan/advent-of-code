### Each daily folder contains:
 * example inputs for test cases
 * puzzle inputs
 * python script used to solve the puzzle
 * README with the puzzle solutions

### My Personal Goals:
 - [x] Explore Python for unseen use-cases
 - [x] Reduce usage of packages wherever possible
 - [x] Improve code readability
 - [x] Form a daily habit
 - [x] Have fun!
