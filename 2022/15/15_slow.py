""" 
This script contains the initial code used to submit part 1's solution.
It only works for one y coordinate and took 45 seconds to solve the input puzzle.
This approach using sets was abandoned for part 2 as it needs to loop over 4000000 y's
and would have taken atleast 8 HOURS to solve part 2.
